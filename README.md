## Static Call Graph Generator - GraphGen

In this project we aimed to implement a static call graph generator using the [JavaParser](https://github.com/javaparser), language parser library.
JavaParser and SymbolSolver has been used for analyzing the method calls of projects and graph is created with [Vis.js](https://github.com/visjs/vis-network) visualization library. To access Vis.js graph through JavaFX, [VisFX](https://github.com/arocketman/VisFX#usage) project was taken as basis. 
As a result, we built an application which can analyze and create a call graph for Java projects of most levels.
