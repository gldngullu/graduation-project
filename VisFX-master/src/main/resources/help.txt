Glad you decided to use GraphGen!
Here is a short information for how to use the application. If you have any other questions feel free to contact! Find the contact information with 'Contact' button.
1) Click 'Open File' button. Select the java project you want to analyze and confirm.

2) Select the source code directory for your project. The directory named as 'source' may give you an idea. The directory you have chosen should be the narrowest directory which covers all the classes you want to analyze.
Say you have the following directories:
__source
____package1
______class1.java
______class2.java
______class3.java
Select the 'source' directory.

Second example:
__src
____main
______java
________package1
__________class1.java
__________class2.java
________package2
__________class3.java
Select the 'java' directory.

3) Select the libraries for your project.
Libraries include all the Java, JavaFX, Maven or Gradle libraries you have for your project.
You can select your '.jar' files or each library directory one by one.
Easily you can select the whole directory which includes all your libraries('.jar' files), but please be informed: it will take more time to progress.
You can also add libraries after, if you miss any.

4) You have your source codes printed. Now you can create the graph. Click to 'Create graph' button.
You can drag the nodes of graph, you can try to click them and you can perform a search on the nodes.

I am sorry to tell you the application may not work for complex applications, with too many nodes or with a different kind of package structure than we expect.
If you run into such an incident, please contact me, so I can improve in the future. :)
